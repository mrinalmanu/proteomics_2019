# proteomics_2019
This repository will contain my results from tutorials taught in proteomics module 2019 at ITMO MS Bioinformatics and Systems Biology course.

#____P.S.

Here is the conclusion about the missing lecture notes:

'Lecture 2 was about a demonstration of proteomics data inside of MaxQuant. I was showing examples from MaxQuant directly, so that is why there is no slides in the presentation. I agree, it is a bit confusing.

I would totally recommend to take a look on this YouTubeâ€™ playlist of the previous MaxQuant summer school. You may find there many in-details videos about proteomics.' -- Pavel Sinitcyn
